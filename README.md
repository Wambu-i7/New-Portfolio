My Story: The Journey Behind This Portfolio

Building this portfolio wasnâ€™t just about creating a website to display my work; it was about growing as a developer and tackling new challenges head-on. One of the most significant challenges I faced was the deployment process, especially configuring Nginx and Gunicorn to run my Flask backend. Through persistence, I learned how to properly deploy a website using VPS, enabling me to gain new technical skills beyond frontend development.

Additionally, while designing the user interface, I wanted to ensure the website was simple yet visually appealing. This meant working with CSS to create responsive layouts and experimenting with JavaScript to add interactive features.

Challenges Faced:

Deployment issues: My biggest struggle was with deploying the website. After setting up the backend with Flask, ensuring it ran smoothly on the server took several attempts and research.

Styling: I initially struggled to make my design look modern and clean while keeping it functional. Learning about CSS best practices helped me polish the final look.


Next Steps:

While the portfolio is fully functional, I have several ideas for future iterations:

Add a blog section to keep visitors updated on my latest projects and learnings.

Implement a full-fledged backend to handle form submissions, potentially integrating with a database.

Enhanced interactivity with animations and advanced JavaScript frameworks.


Through this project, I not only showcased my current skills but also paved the way for future learning and growth. Itâ€™s been a great learning experience, and I look forward to improving it as I continue to evolve as a developer.
